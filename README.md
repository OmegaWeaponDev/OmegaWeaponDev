Hey there! ðŸ˜„

My name is OmegaWeaponDev and I am a SpigotMC/PaperMC plugin developer as well as a beginner Game Developer (Using C++ and Unreal Engine 4)

Currently I am more focused learning game development I am still highly into making plugins for people and providng the best support I possibly can for the current (5) plugins that I currently have listed on SpigotMC website which you can find here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/omegaweapondev.14953/

If you are wanting a custom plugin developed for you, or needing some support for one of the plugins I offer, or even just wanting to have a chat. You are more than welcome to join the public discord server that I have created. You can find the invite link here: https://discord.gg/9nZTPcp.

The projects I am currently working on are:

    A full recode of my plugin JoinPrivileges
    A Udemy Unreal Engine C++ Course that I have been enjoying online
